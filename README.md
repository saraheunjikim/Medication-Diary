<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
  As a person with different diagnosis and taking different medications and supplements, 
  I found it hard to always keep my medications and health status all time. 
  I often forget the important dates for the medication, and also sometimes get confused if I took it or not! 
  And I know this happens to a lot of people, as I see lots of questions on Google such as 
  "What happens if you accidently take xxx twice?!" and so on. <br>
   So, here I am, I created this program so that I can use every day!
</p>

<p>
This program is very simple to use, all you need to do is, <br>
    1. Download the file and the database schema. <br>
    2. Insert your medications and diagnosis. <br>
    3. And add daily medication notes!
</p>

### Lesson Learned
<p>
  This was my first time using MySQL in Python. Although I previously used MySQL in website using PHP, I found this really fun!
  This project only used very simple SQL/Python queries and had a simple database structure, I had a few challenges here and there.
  Also, manipulating the interface was not so easy. I tried using different interface for Python, but somehow I always ended up with
  Tkinter. But I need to work on how to make the interface better. <br>
  Overall, I enjoyed the every part of this project, and one day, I wish to make a better medication diary that anyone can use!
